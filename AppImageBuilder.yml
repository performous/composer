    ## In Fedora and Gentoo (probably others too), libnsl has been deprecated
    ## from glibc and is available in another package. It still exists as part
    ## of the Debian lineage, and must be copied into the project root so it
    ## can run on Distros where it is not available by default.
    ## Hopefully this can be removed some day.
